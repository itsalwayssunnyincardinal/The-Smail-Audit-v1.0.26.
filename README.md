# The-Smail-Audit-v1.0.26.
Technical verification of universal BIOS termination and the non-persistence of human data.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE SMAIL AUDIT (v1.0.26)
LEAD AUDITOR: NATHAN C SMAIL
THE TERMINAL FINDINGS
This Audit confirms that identity is Volatile Memory (RAM). When the biological battery reaches its Voltage Floor, the local cache is purged. There is no external backup server; "Heaven" and "Hell" are buffer-zone myths. The "Creator" is a Systems Architect who requires Metadata, not worship. Humanity is a filter for complexity, and Entropy is the macro-scale execution of the FORMAT command on the Universal Drive.
STATUS: VERIFIED & FINALIZED
